# SFML Project Template

This is a Visual Studio C++26 project template which has been preconfigured to implement the SFML 3.0 C++ library - includes and libs are already setup!

The project's main source file includes code for a simple SFML graphical demonstration. Use this code sample as a staging point on which to develop your own SFML project.
